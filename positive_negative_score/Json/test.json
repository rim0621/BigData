So hooray for Agatha Christie! Her thrillers are plot-focused (rather than designed to show off how clever she thinks she is), admirably economical, and contain some really appealing characters.Hilary Craven is a woman who has lost her husband and child, and is seeking escape by travelling to Morocco. But once there, she discovers that her problems are within her - that there is no escape. She decides to end her life, but is interrupted by the practical Mr Jessop. Jessop has previously been encountered investigating the disappearance of Thomas Betterton, another brilliant scientist who has vanished without a trace. He suggests that if Hilary is so bent on death, she could make herself useful to him while she seeks it. Deciding that she's up to the challenge and convinced that death is what she really wants, Hilary impersonates the wife of Thomas Betterton and heads off into the unknown. She waits for Mrs Betterton's mysterious allies to contact her and take her to join her \"husband\", knowing she will be beyond help if her ruse is discovered. And once she is contacted, then the fun really begins.Hilary is a great character, the mystery she gets caught up in is a satisfying one, and as with all Christie novels, there is a great sense of era as the concerns and foibles of the 1950s (when this book was written) are brought to life.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Satisfying thriller", "unixReviewTime": 1049328000, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2003"}

But over the years I've come to prefer DU to BAGHDAD, maybe as I've grown older and more reflective.  The insouciant and devil may care heroine of BAGHDAD, Victoria Jones, was once more appealing to me, and the social comedy of that book remains a delight.  But now I am in a Hilary Craven state of mind.  If you ask me, Hilary Craven is one of Christie's greatest accomplishments as a character, and her gradual transformation during the events of her \"ritualized suicide\" is so skillfully done it's hard to see how it could be improved.At first she is a frightened, despondent mess, as a result of catastrophes in her personal life, a broken marriage, and the death of her only child, a little girl.  She keeps obsessing about Brenda, the dead girl, and visualizing the pathetic tiny mound of her grave.  She decides to commit suicide and nothing is going to stop her.  Christie takes you deep inside Hilary's mind, and her decision seems perfectly rational and even moral, and then fate knocks at her door.  In a way we've heard Christie tell this story before, because a would-be suicide turns into the hero of TOWARDS ZERO, and we get some idea of her philosophy on the subject--don't kill yourself because of the butterfly effect, and you never know when you might save someone else's life if only you live.  DESTINATION UNKNOWN shows signs of Christie's interest in French existentialism, and the questions it asks are pretty deep ones.  What is the price of personal freedom?  Is freedom an illusion?  In paradise--real or imagined--is there any freedom of choice?  If humans are infinitely adaptable and can get used to anything, where is the spark that separates us from the animals?  Is identity itself a learned response?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Creeping Unknown", "unixReviewTime": 1241740800, "reviewTime": "05 8, 2009"}

Comparing Along Came a Spider to A Farewell To Arms is like comparing a Mozart symphony to current pop music. That said, you will find a pretty good crime thriller that you can run through in a couple days. That's the reason the work is a massive bestseller. I thought the plot was compelling but, even at 500+ pages, I didn't really feel that much for the victims. Patterson devotes much more development time to the \"bad guys\". Also, superfluous writing crops up every now and then. For example, I remember one part where a criminal says something along the lines of: \"Believe whatever the hell you want.\" Then after that quote, we get this profound commentary from the narrator: \"He didn't care what I thought.\" Well, obviously! Not a major problem, but it comes across as a little amateur.Still, even after those criticisms, I did mostly enjoy the book.

I love Alex Cross, but most of the series only get 3 or 4, and everything after \"Violets are Blue\" gets only 1 star. Here is why:  Patterson had a very strong creation in Alex Cross. He was an interesting character with flaws and emotions. Also, he wasn't a \"tough-guy\" hero; he was a man who used his mind to solve crimes. He is a psychologist, not a rogue cop that makes up his own rules.  Also, in this book he is pitted against a very unique and clever villain - Gary Soneji - a madman who kidnaps a young girl from a private school who has a very powerful father.This book has a great plot and moves at a breakneck speed. There is little time for description or introspection on the part of the characters, and that is what makes this book great. There are countless twists and turns, and the reader is constantly guessing. Now, that being said, it is Patterson's style of writing that makes this book amazing, and the rest of them derivative pulp.  Patterson insists on having over 100 chapters in each of his books. This is not to say they are long books, rather each chapter is merely 2-3 pages long. This in itself is not the problem. The problem is that each chapter starts halfway down the page [leaving half a page of white space] and the chapter will end at the beginning of a new page, only a few lines down [leaving another half page of white space].  I have heard many readers say that they love Patterson, because they read his books so quickly. Well, the fact is that the buyer is paying for about 35 percent white space in any given Patterson book - which is only about 300 pages long in the first place! Now, again, I am not saying this is bad. It is a technique that gives the feeling of incredible suspense as one is literally turning the pages faster than can be imagined when reading a book of substance. However, after the first book in this series I was tired of this device, and I can finish an Alex Cross book in just over an hour.  I may as well have been watching television!  Anyhow, this first book is worth reading, however, please be skeptical of anyone who thinks they are literati because they can devour a whole Patterson book in one sitting.  Buy this book, but make sure that you buy the rest of this series from a used book store so Patterson is not rewarded for his 120 pages of white space per novel.Relic113", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best in the Series...", "unixReviewTime": 1140220800, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2006"}

It's a chilling read, with an excellent and truly original plot. Alex Cross comes across as a great compassionate character, who has much life in him. But Unfortunately, patterson tired him out very quickly.With this book Patterson created one of his most chilling victims. He is chilling because Patterson spends time making him so. Developing his character. With his latest books, Patterson doesn't bother developing his villains )or ANY of his characters, for that matter) and just expects us to believe him when he says they are \"a chilling and terrifying killer\" and leaves it at that. With this book, he really shwos us what he can do. He is listening to his fans to much when they say \"can't you write faster\". He has chosen to do so, and in doing that has sacrificed good characters and original plots.This book was a great pageturner and a great thriller, with a really brilliant and unexpected twist right at the end.

The world depicted in FLUX is a staggering conceptual achievement, taking the amazing concept of neutron-star life first suggested by Frank Drake and developed by Robert L. Forward in DRAGON'S EGG &amp; STARQUAKE and going one step further, creating an ecosystem within the neutron-superfluid mantle of the star and exploring its whole geography from crust to core.  The biology, locomotion and senses of the inhabitants are well worked out.But Baxter's imagination tends to outrace even him.  In both his books I've read, there have been major flaws in logic, points on which he failed to think his ideas through.  Here, for story convenience, he asserts that the nuclear-size humanoids' life and thought processes happen at normal human speed.  Readers of Forward will see the absurdity of this.  The nucleonic processes on which this life is based are a million times faster than chemistry, because the particles are so much closer together.  Even if it were possible to slow these people's life cycles so much in proportion to the underlying processes, they'd be agonizingly slower than the native organisms around them, living on a slower timescale than even the plants.  There are other moments of shortsightedness; sometimes he describes them in humanlike ways incompatible with the anatomy and physics he's defined.  (How could Dura have &quot;slick palms&quot; when they don't perspire?)When the reason for these micro-humans' creation is finally revealed, it doesn't make sense.  It would've been more logical to build mindless robots for the task, and ones better-designed to fit the environment.  The creators' choice to make them almost exactly human down to the same impractical anatomy and the same emotions and aspirations shows a sentimentalism fiercely incompatible with the project's goals.Baxter also gets confused about the scale of his trademark structure, Bolder's Ring.  In VACUUM DIAGRAMS he said it was millions of light-years across -- yet described an attack on its rim affecting its center instantaneously, and described a distant observer seeing the battle across its whole width in real time. And here, he describes it appearing tiny from a distance of mere thousands of light-years.  Baxter seems to have trouble realizing the physical and temporal scope of his own creations.  His imagination is bigger than his judgment.Baxter's a far better writer than Forward, but as in Forward's books, the plot is basically an excuse for illustrating the environment and physics.  His characters have a modicum of emotion and personality, unlike Forward's, but are sometimes superficially drawn and hard to get a handle on.  The one sexual interlude is painfully awkward and gratuitous from a character standpoint, serving only to illustrate the mechanics of the act for this species.  (And let's not go into Baxter's seeming obsession with bodily functions.  He could've chosen a more pleasant term for biological jet-propulsion.)Amid the superlatively exotic setting, the society is relentlessly ordinary and unimaginative.  The sociological storyline replays the mythology of countless British WWII films (and American films about Britain, such as MRS. MINIVER) -- a stratified society is torn apart by disaster and becomes united, promising to rebuild as an egalitarian utopia.  It's tacked on quite awkwardly here. Overall, Baxter pulls the reader in two different directions -- in the environment and physics he strives for unimagined wonders, but for the people and society he pulls against that and forces them to be as mundane and familiar as possible.FLUX portrays the most extraordinarily alien, yet credibly developed, physical environment I have ever seen in SF.  But this just throws the book's flaws and its ordinary storytelling into sharp relief.  And Baxter's failure to think through all the ramifications of his own ideas, and the huge logic gaffes that result, are a continual frustration.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Baxter has vision, but it's blurred", "unixReviewTime": 985737600, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2001"}

Hers is a feudal society with strict stratification of the different classes. Verbal history tells of a once more technological society now lost after the Core Wars.  Sounds preposterous, I know, but Baxter's greatest strength is that, despite the heavy duty science in his works, he never loses sight of the human element. His story of Dura, an upfluxer and her adventures in Parz City and beyond, is so engaging that the reader can forget that the technicalities of the story and enjoy the adventure.Through a series of good, bad and dumb luck, Dura finds herself at the center of an expedition that is the only hope of saving the Human Beings in her particular star. Through her tribes legends of the Xeelee she is able to engineer a meeting with a Colonist - a denizen of the core of the star, a downloaded copy of the original humans to seed the star with Dura's people - and formulate a plan that will save all the species of humanity from destruction. And consequently re-engineer a fairer and more just way of life.It's hard to find Science Fiction these days that actually has some science in it.

But I prefer Plaidy's Catherine over Gregory's any day.First I'll say that Plaidy shows Catherine as a product of her environment, a girl who never really had a chance. She was sweet-natured, loving, forgiving and just happy. This may have caused her to act foolishly, but Plaidy made her foolishness more organic than Gregory ever did. Catherine in this book was more unlucky to me than just plain stupid. I don't think it's really fair to call her stupid when she was never really taught.In contrast to Gregory's Catherine, Plaidy shows her from her earliest childhood years to the very end. I felt that Plaidy made her a bit more fleshed out, more real, human; instead of an air-headed bimbo with nothing to care about but clothing and jewelry. Plaidy almost made Catherine Howard seem intelligent.Catherine here is seen to pay even some attention to her surroundings. Unfortunately when she tries to join in on a conversation she is told to remain silent and treated like she's nothing more than a chair in a room. I felt that she was treated like a child the entire way through the book until she became Queen of England.I also felt that Plaidy made Henry more likable here. He's shown to be a sweet older man, until he becomes angry, but with Catherine he's like a grandfather, with sweets. Because Catherine isn't so concerned with politics this book shows a softer side of Henry missing in other books I've read about him.Unfortuantely Catherine's past comes back to haunt her in a way no one thought it would. It ends with her death and the death of two of the men who truly loved her.

To begin with, let's agree that Katherine was never given a fair chance in comparison to the King's other wives. Katherine was not as extravagant, well-known, or amazingly beautiful as some of the more renowned ones were. She was extremely young to be a bride; a child in fact. So, this in itself puts her in a category of her own.The author brilliantly exposes this fact by writing in the first person, so that we are never to forget the fact that she was merely a child. Reading it from this point of view makes the history so much more understandable. It is difficult to be judgmental towards Katherine in any way when you read the story through her perspective.Katherine Howard's life is pretty simple up until she moves into the Royal Court; where, she is ultimately set-up for her demise. The events in her life unfold like a cruel domino effect, led by the deceptions and scheming of others leading Katherine to her tragic end. Her innocence, kindness, curiosity, and acts without malice, rendered her character simply endearing. Plaidy captures the essence of this Child-Belle enraptured in a world of delusion, schemes and intrigues. The game was too quick and too fierce for her to endure. Inevitably, this young girl's innocent and hopeful nature could never survive in the vulturous world of Henry VIII.The Rose Without a Thorn is a quick read that moves you from one scene to the next in smooth and inviting transition. The passages are moving and although I often felt exasperated by some of Katherine's decisions and motives, I felt I understood this character precisely because of her circumstances. The build up to the tragedy is difficult and ultimately heartbreaking.

The writing is as masterful as always, and even if you're familiar with the tale of Katherine Howard, I think you'll find yourself wrapped up in this book.  The story starts out with Katherine talking to her friend, the scribe, and it is all presented as the story she is telling to the scribe in the days leading up to her death.Katherine is portrayed as a mostly thoughtless girl who lives entirely for the present, which is totally how I've always thought of her.

At one point, Katherine even says that while she believed her cousin to be innocent, she knew she herself was not.Although this story is not a new one to me, it was presented in a new way in that Katherine knew her actions were dangerous and she gave in to them heedless of the consequences.  She was almost noble at times, wanting to protect Thomas Culpepper as much as she could and refraining from saying anything that would implicate him in any way.  With that in mind, it's very sad to me that she did what she could to protect him, but didn't seem to be trying to protect Francis Derehem in any way.

She would be her own (and everyone else's) undoing. I cannot imagine that they were all that shocked when the poop hit the fan. Her uncle (the Duke) probably just gave a deep sigh and shook his head...And it hardly matters if Katherine had no knowledge that she'd be a queen. Her 'betters' knew. Because Katherine was being prepared for 'something' (though that 'something' remained to be seen for a time). Or what else was the point in moving to the Duchess' home or establishing a position at Court? The Duchess at least should have been keeping an eye on the young lady.I suppose the lure of the Crown was too much though...I'm guessing.Still, to put Katherine in Henry's sights was a grave mistake. Because it was Katherine.She had other redeeming qualities. She was kindhearted & good-natured. She seems to have been sweet and loving--but she seems to have been something of a simple girl. Entirely unsuited to the environment she was thrust into, the unscrupulous and craftier personalities around her or the 'games' that she was forced to play.The Duke came to her in an attempt to warn her that supplying the King's enemies w/clothes could be taken badly. Rather than taking heed--she engaged him.Thomas Culpepper came to warn her about taking certain ppl (who were knowledgeable of past) into her household. That she was Queen and needed to understand the politics of the situation. That there were other political factions at work. Using her...and working against her.She responded with surprise and confusion---and ended up sleeping with Culpepper that same night!SMHShe had relations, affairs and flirtations with Derham, Manox and Culpepper. All 3 and especially Culpepper, shouldn't have EVER managed to get that close to her. Yet, she places them in her household...?...and Lady Rochford? Why have such a woman in your personal space? She has the blood of Anne & George Boleyn on her hands with her false testimonies.I read another account that implied that Katherine was somewhat blackmailed into appointing other witnesses to her Court. She was a woman--but goodness she was still a Queen. She still had influence...and only a few ppl knew the truth about her.These witnesses and participants could have either been persuaded or threatened into silence.The objective would be to nip it in the bud BEFORE the gossip has a chance to 'grow legs'.Also, the Katherine as depicted in this book could have made better use of the Duke.Now, he may not have had been the most decent person out there. He was self-serving and uncaring. A horrid man by some accounts. Certainly wasn't likeable.I doubt he would risk his head for her BUT---he was ambitious and everything he did was done for the sake of the 'Family'.So of course he would look out for Katherine's best interests. He had to. His and Katherine's (good)fortune were intertwined. Looking out for Katherine was looking out for himself.He had inside knowledge and was no novice when it comes to court affairs.A person like this is useful as an advisor.But you don't just cast someone like this aside.Katherine seems to have isolated HERSELF and chose to place vipers in her midst. I can't fathom someone in her position making these kinds of mistakes.But, ppl like her do exist. They are too wayyy 'gentle' for world. Too trusting and light-hearted.

Plaidy's other novel about Katherine Howard,Murder Most Royal: The Story of Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, was published in 1949, more than a decade before the publication of Lacey Baldwin Smith's ground-breaking study of Katherine,A Tudor tragedy;: The life and times of Catherine Howard. Murder Most Royal therefore re-hashed, through no fault on the author's part, subsequently discredited theories, e.g. that Katherine and Thomas Culpeper were first cousins (according to Smith's researches they were only sixth cousins), that they were childhood sweethearts and that Katherine, in her scaffold speech, said, \"I die a queen, but I would rather die the wife of Thomas Culpeper\". One might think that someone who wrote so many historical novels and whose bibliographies are littered with history books would have stumbled across A Tudor Tragedy by 1993, when The Rose Without a Thorn was published (incidentally, the same year that Plaidy died).Apparently not. Smith's study is not listed in the bibliography. Neither are the books about Henry VIII's six wives by Alison Weir and Antonia Fraser, published in 1991 and 1992. And so The Rose Without a Thorn re-hashes all those old stories about Katherine Howard that had been discredited thirty years earlier. Plaidy has Katherine giving the scaffold speech \"I die a Queen, but I would rather die the wife of Thomas Culpeper\". Katherine and Culpeper are portrayed as close cousins. Katherine is portrayed as being about eighteen years old when she went to Court, when according to modern research she may have been as young as fifteen, and as going to Court after Anne of Cleves was already queen, instead of arriving there in time to be a maid of honour when Anne arrived. Katherine is also portrayed as saying, at the time of her arrest and interrogation, \"I knew little of the ways of the world. I believed myself betrothed to Francis Derham and that that meant we could behave as husband and wife\" when, as Smith shows, Katherine vehemently denied that she had ever been betrothed to her former lover Francis Dereham, even though admitting to such a pre-contract could potentially have saved her life (by denying it the councillors dug deeper, and found out about her much more serious dealings with Thomas Culpeper after her marriage, leading to her being attainted for treason and executed). And, bizarrely, the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk is portrayed as being Katherine's actual grandmother rather than her step-grandmother - her late grandfather's second wife - even though Plaidy got this correct in Murder Most Royal.The Rose Without a Thorn is not a complete travesty of historical fiction - technically the writing are storytelling are competent. But they're both superficial and, of course, the content is out of date. If you've read a fair amount about Henry VIII's six wives and are looking for an accurate depiction of events then it's probably best not to bother with this book, since its mistakes and discredited theories will irritate you. If wonderful storytelling is all you're after then it would be better to read Murder Most Royal.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Don't bother if you're after historical accuracy", "unixReviewTime": 1368057600, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2013"}

A masterful storyteller, the author, who also writes under the name Victoria Holt and has a cavalcade of devoted readers, creates a work of historical fiction that will transport the reader to another time.The book details the rise and fall of Katherine Howard, a young, impoverished noblewoman of an illustrous family. As a young girl, she was sent to live with her grandmother, the Duchess of Norfolk, where she, unfortunately, fell in with a licentious group of retainers and became ensnared in two unsuitable affairs of the heart. Little did she know that they would serve to haunt her a way she could never have imagined.An opportunity, orchestrated by her Machiavellian and ambitious uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, arises for the beautiful, though foolish, Katherine to go to the Royal Court as Lady -In-Waiting to the fourth wife of Henry VIII, the kindly Anne of Cleves. Katherine obligingly goes. There, she falls in love with her cousin, Thomas Culpepper, a gentleman of the King's Bed Chamber. Her hopes of marriage to her handsome cousin are soon dashed, however, when she catches the wandering eye of the King, who loathes his current wife.Having charmed the King and having little say in the matter, Katherine becomes his fifth wife, once he divorces Anne of Cleves. Katherine's initial happiness as Queen is cut short, however, when her lurid past comes to light and is brought to the King's attention. This, coupled with her indiscretions with Thomas Culpepper, are enough to abruptly terminate her brief reign over England as its Queen and cause a number of heads, including hers, to roll.This is an intriguing blend of fact and fiction, which is laced with enough historical detail to satisfy those readers who enjoy historical fiction.

She has a style that is both infomative and addicting. She is able to put a familiar face on a woman that lived so long ago and make you feel like you know her on a personal level. The Rose Without a Thorn is a 260 page novel that's written from the perspective of Katharine Howard, Henry VIII's fifth wife, and his second to lose her head.Katharine was raised in the household of her grandmother, the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk. She was taken into the households of Horsham and Lambeth at 10 years old because he parents were too poor to give her a proper upbringing. She was enchanted by her music tutor, Henry Manox and had a fairly innocent love affair with him. Katharine meets Francis Dereham soon after casting off Henry Manox. She starts her relationship with him at age 15, right after the death of Jane Seymour, who was Henry VIII's third wife. Francis Dereham and Katharine swear to marry each other. They are soon discovered by her grandmother and he is banished and leaves for Ireland. She receives a place at court with Anne of Cleves at age 18. Dereham returns not long after and she dismisses him and their relationship as \"child's play.\" There is talk of betrothal between her and her cousin, Thomas Culpepper. When she enters court, she befriends Jane Rochford, who is still something of a paraiah after the execution of her husband and sister-in-law. She catches the eye of the king when she is forced to sing at a banquet. Henry has his marriage to Anne of Cleves annulled and makes Katharine his new wife. After becoming queen, Katharine is blackmailed by one of her grandmother's former ladies, Joan Bulmer. Joan threatens to tell of Katharine's indiscretions when she was at her grandmother's unless she gets a place as a lady in waiting. Soon after Joan joins Katharine's household, Henry Manox returns and is given a place with the court musicians. Dereham then returns and is appointed Katharine's secretary. The king leaves on a campaign to restore peace in the northern territories and while he is gone, Katharine starts up her affair with Thomas Culpepper, who is she totally in love with, with the help of Jane Rochford. Katharine is charged with treason for her early affairs and lying about them to the king. Three ladies from her grandmother's house all testified against her - Joan Bulmer, Kathryn Tylney, and Mary Lassels. Dereham and Culpepper are executed for their affairs with Katharine.

This shorter volume tells of Katharine Howard, the cousin of Anne Boleyn who also became queen of England and who also shared a similiar fate. Katharine is born into an impoverished branch of the Howard family, a very noble English family that is also very stable at court. When her powerful Grandmother comes to visit their meager country estate, Katharine intrigues her Grandmother and is whisked off to live at her Grandmother's large and beautiful estate. While there, her Grandmother neglects her and Katharine gives into the daring acts of the girls who work in the estate who share her bechamber. Katharine befriends her music teacher, Mannox, and invites him into her bed at night. The affair ends fast and one Francis Weston comes into Katharine's life. However, this ends once Katharine's Grandmother comes upon Francis and Katharine frolicking upon a parlor floor. Around this time Anne Boleyn is crowned queen and so the entire entourage and family moves to the Lambeth estate on the Thames River in London. Now Katharine falls for her own cousin, Thomas Culpepper. However, Katharine's powerful uncle has plans for his neice and finds her a place in Anne of Cleves short-lived entourage (Anne Boleyn has hence forth been executed and Jane Seymour has died). Henry VIII begins to notice Katharine and after demissing his marriage to Anne of Cleves, he courts Katharine and soon she is thrust onto the same stage her older cousin came upon a decade or so before. Katharine is wedded to the king in a short ceremony and soon begins her short reign as Queen of England. However, when rumors of her past affairs come back Katharine finds herself in danger. Franics Weston comes to court, as does Mannox, bringing back haunting memories that could cost Katharine her head. But when Katharine commits adultery with Thomas Culpepper one night, her fate is sealed. Henry, in his first happy marriage in decades, is brought the horrible news by those insanely jealous of Katharine's new fame and the Howard's rising fortune (even though they were already very dominant and had more power than the Tudors). Katharine is guilty, as are her lovers, and all are brought to the block or the gallows. And even on the scafold Katharine declared &quot;I die a queen, but I would rather die the wife of Thomas Culpepper&quot;. I loved this book and found it highly enjoyable. I find it no wonder that Jean Plaidy is acclaimed a sone of the greatest historical fiction writers ever.

This story does not conjur up half the magic of Bradley's masterpiece, but it does satisfactorily probe some of that primordial mystery that shrouds the ancient world and its people.  In this tale, unhappy adolescent Adam spends most of his time on the hillside where the Celtic stone from another century proudly stands. Little does he know, but the stone is a gateway to another time, a time where Druid Priestess-in-training, Brid, is able to pass from her time, the 6th century into the far future---Adam's time in the 20th century.  At first he views the vivacious Brid as a marvelous playmate, but when she initiates him into the pleasures of sexual love, he is smitten--at least for while.  As Adam matures, he leaves his home village and sad childhood to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor.  His life moves onto other women, marriage and children of his own.  However, Brid does not move on, she is still the young and beautiful Druidess who defies her family and her religious traditions to pursue Alan across the boundaries of time.  Her obsession is all-encompassing; she lets nothing stop her from getting back into Alan's life and to control him in the only way she can--in his bed. Brid's melancholy and frustration is uniquely portrayed by Erskine--indeed it permeates the tone of the entire story.Ms Erskine is surely the master of the obsessive tale; the reader while finding Brid somewhat annoying after plaguing Alain for over 50 years, can understand her bewilderment over aging Alan's puzzling behavior when defending his frazzled family from her, and commiserate with both their mutual attraction for one another and Alan's disgust with himself as he falls prey over and over again to Brid's charms.  After three generarions of daunting pursuit and umpteen pages, it is to the reader's great relief that with the help of a powerful present day druid and Alan's grandchild, Brid's claim on Alan can finally be loosened and Brid's own immortal soul released from her uncle's grasp.Although I enjoyed this book and found it hard to put down, I must say I enjoyed Erskine's earlier works much more.  In particular, &quot;House of Shadows&quot; certainly pricked those tiny hairs off the back of my neck!

Unbeknownst to him, a portal in time has opened, allowing Adam and Brid, who is actually a Druid from the sixth century, to cross back and forth in time.

In  leaving the heartsick Brid behind and consigning her to his memories, he takes his life in a seemingly new direction.Brid, on the other hand, forsaking the teachings of her people and incurring the wrath of her powerful uncle and a sure sentence of death, is dead serious about Adam, and she goes through the time portal in search of him.

After finishing this book I glanced at the cover and re-read the mini-review posted there (see above) and I couldn't agree more.  In many ways this is typical Sidney Sheldon: the main character is a beautiful heroine caught up in amazing situations filled with adventure and exotic locales; love and lust, power and privilege, fame and riches waiting to be experienced.  But as this book stands, it was a little too typical.  The writing is standard mass-market mediocrity loaded with tons of dialogue to keep the pace flowing like quicksilver, and the scenarios are often so predictable as to be anti-climactic.  The structure of the story is a bit odd, however, as the very beginning feels like a novella that ends abruptly midway through the book.  What follows are a series of capers that could have been sectioned off as short-stories if not for the recurring main characters.  If you are new to Sidney Sheldon I most heartily recommend \"Master of the Game\" over any of his other works.  \"The Sands of Time\" is also worth checking out.  \"If Tomorrow Comes\" is enjoyable for what it is: a quick, entertaining read.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "\"For entertainment purposes only.\"", "unixReviewTime": 1146700800, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2006"}

Along the way she meets several colorful characters. Imagining herself a modern day Robin Hood, she is careful to only swindle those who would swindle themselves. The reader will find herself surprised to be rooting on the bad guys, enjoying a vicarious thrill or two, and smiling at the crazy plots Tracy manages to pull off.This book is a quick, easy beach read and one that will stay with you long after you turn the final page.

The main character and heroine, Tracy White working for a man named Gunther, becomes a modern Robin Hood ripping off cardboard characters of unsavory reputations with no logical reason at all, just for the sake of doing.

At the same time, the Iranian government, who is in cahoots with India, China, and Japan, is also taking over Iraq after having assassinated the leader.  The world is on the cusp of major problems and the leader of the most powerful nation, arriving there without having been elected, has to answer the call.  But, what's more, the former vice-president, who resigned because of a sex scandal, now claims that he should technically be the vice-president.Jack Ryan holds up under the pressure, but in order to bring the U.S. under control he has to enact martial law, closing down numerous major cities to prevent the spread of e-bola.  He also sends John Clark and some other members of Rainbow Six into Iran to assassinate the person running the show.  When everything comes to a close, e-bola is contained, the quasi-hostile takeover of Iraq is stopped, and everything returns to normal.My Comments:The book wasn't too bad, but I really didn't see why the takeover of Iraq by Iran was such a big deal.  Sure, international politics are sensitive and tricky, but considering the stability of the Iranian government, as opposed to the Iraqi government, I can't see how it's so bad that the government fell (maybe I'm naive, I don't claim expertise on international politics).There is also a lack of focus on Jack Ryan, as most of these later books have done.  Ryan disappears from the foreground into the mix of characters and doesn't really appear to be the primary focus of the novel.  The novel also jumps around from character to character, introducing one for just a scene or a chapter, then never really returning to them.Most of these problems may be addressed in the actual novel, which is quite lengthy.  But the abridged, CD version, which is the one I listened to, just doesn't give this story the depth that it really needs.  As is the case with most of these later novels (which I happened to listen to one right after another, but in the reverse order), the CD versions were just not as well-developed as a good novel should be.

The obstacles present in being president with little or no support system.  Clancy shows the flaws in the career politician mentality that has become Washington.

{"reviewerID": "A3K04FH6E3EB8", "asin": "0006479758", "reviewerName": "A. Katko", "helpful": [7, 8], "reviewText": "Clancy's quality shot downhill, man. This is where his books moved from entertaining, engaging reads throughout to techno-porn and drivel. Red October, Clear and Present Danger, Patriot Games, and Without Remorse are his best ones, and the reasons are simple. They also provide a clear contrast with this book.1) The best, particularly Patriot Games and Without Remorse, are character and plot-driven. When characters develop, you can see it happen and understand the reasoning. They also don't solely fulfill stereotypes/archetypes, like the godless, moral-less mercenary terrorist. This loses that completely aside from Ryan and Ryan alone, and he's been developed plenty in the preceding books. I don't care about archetypal Indian Prime Ministers who are solely politicians and offer nothing interesting. I don't care about the aforementioned terrorist who is never even named. If a character arises that I do find interesting (IE Badrayn), I expect them to stay in the plot or at least have some resolution, not disappear halfway through when they should be central to the plot.2) They're not techno-porn. Part of Clancy's appeal has always been his realism, of course. The battle towards the end of this book is about a full 100 pages too long. Running through the minutiae of a large-scale tank battle without providing background on most of the commanders? Boring. Sum of All Fears is the worst about this but only in an isolated section - the techno-porn pervades this entire book and makes it quite hard to read, even for an engineering grad student.3) They're not preachy. The morality of the characters, fine, help explain their motivations. Discuss the problems associated with treating drug lords as criminals vs terrorists vs enemies of the state. This is where Clancy decided that he knows the solution to every political problem and his views are the only ones that make sense. Ok, rebuilding the government from scratch essentially is an interesting topic - doesn't mean I care at all that Clancy wants a flat tax. Red Rabbit is easily the worst in terms of this, but this book is where it started. Political drivel spouted from the characters fits - political drivel spouted from the narrator doesn't.

The books aren't padded out (at least the good ones) with ridiculous plots that do absolutely nothing for the story. The subplot in this book about the Mountain Men serves no purpose whatsoever besides lengthening the story. They never meet up with any other characters, there's no evidence that any other pivotal characters ever learn they exist, and their plan amounts to nothing in the middle of nowhere. I can't believe the editor let this garbage stay in the story. Solely padding the story out.You can see the problems I have with this book. There are some interesting ideas, though - the reaction of world leaders to an untested new president who has never been scrutinized is intriguing. The political aspects are, also. There are way, way too many flaws here to overcome them, though. Clancy used to be able to spin a good yarn - Without Remorse is an excellent story and an excellent book. This is neither.

Even as the Capitol building smolders and the late President Roger Durling is laid to rest, unfriendly eyes are watching the new and untried President Ryan for signs of weakness...and begin plotting his -- and America's -- downfall.In Iran, Ayatollah Mahmoud Haji Daryaei (one of the opponents of the Fowler Peace Plan in &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;) broods in his office and begins to set in motion a series of crises that will tie up America's already over-extended military and intelligence services. Daryaei enlists not only his own operatives in Iran and abroad, but also the leaders of two other nations with global ambitions of their own.  By creating a series of seemingly unrelated crises all at once, including an Iranian &quot;merger&quot; with Iraq and renewed tensions between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan, Daryaei hopes to distract American attention and pave the way for a savage attack on both President Ryan and millions of American citizens.But Ryan has made many enemies at home, too, including the former Vice-President, Edward Kealty, who had been forced to resign in the wake of a personal scandal.  With the skills and connections he has made during his many years in Washington, Kealty begins a campaign to remove the still-untried Ryan from the Presidency.Clancy's huge novel is both compelling and complex, taking the reader from the ruins of the Capitol to the jungles of Africa and into the crowded streets of Tehran as President Ryan begins the awesome task of rebuilding a government decimated by a terrible act of revenge...and facing a loose confederacy of enemies bent on destroying his country, his family, and his life.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "America under siege in Clancy classic chiller....", "unixReviewTime": 1065225600, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2003"}

Have you felt youcould do the job at least as well as the folks who have heldit in the past few decades, if not better? Perhaps you havewondered what day-to-day life must be like in the WhiteHouse. It looks pretty plush, but what would it be like toactually live there? Or perhaps you wander what the secretservice folks are really like?If the answer to any of these questions is yes, you aregoing to love Executive Orders. The novel begins where Debtof Honor left off, and Jack Ryan (through a series of eventsI won't reveal, since some of you may not have read theprevious book yet) is now President. And as always, he facesa bowl full of crises, enough to destroy most men.Let's see. He has to deal with a new Arab country, theUnited Islam Republic, created when Iran's latest leaderarranges for the assassination of Sudam Hussein and takesover that country. China's leaders also start things goingwhen they provoke a dogfight with some of Taiwan's fighterplanes and shoot down a civilian airliner in the process.Then Ed Kealty, the model of a corrupt politician, tries toquestion Ryan's authority as president, and begins to leaksome of the secret missions in which  Ryan had participatedwhile in the CIA (and which Clancy wrote about in earlierbooks). Appealing to our fears about biological warfare, afew new cases of Ebola, the most deadly modern virus,suddenly spread to our own country. And to keep hisattention sharp, there are assassination attempts on bothhimself and his family.As always, Clancy jumps from scene to scene, perhapsmore than ever. It is well done, however, and helps to buildsuspense. Thus the events which make up one sub-plot mayextend for several hundred pages.Interestingly enough, this book has not gotten goodreviews from many of Clancy's readers. They argue that itcontains a lot of irrelevant material, particularly in hispolitical exposition. Admittedly he does push his particularphilosophy; there is no hidden agenda, however, for hededicates the book to Ronald Reagan, (the man who won thewar) and many of his ideas are similar to Reagan's and hisfollowers. I felt, however, that this was an important partof the book, for Ryan is not a professional politician, anda main thrust of the novel is his attempt to bring commonsense to the problems that face our nation. I might notalways agree with his solutions, but they were quiteconsistent with his character.It is also fun to wonder What if . . . He wants tosimplify the tax code, for example, by doing away with alltax exemptions and using a flat percentage tax that wouldapply to all income levels. This, President Ryan argues,would bring in just as much income from the rich folks whonow use the complexity of the current code to exempt much oftheir income. It would also have the side affect of doingaway with many of the accountants and attorneys whospecialize in tax law (a benefit that I suspect some of ouraccountants and attorneys might not see).I recommend this book, though I also suggest you readDebt of Honor first to get the background.

Clancy has written a book with over 1,300 pages.  And so it should come as no surprise that I found the story slow. I mean, how many fast paced 1,300-paged books do you know of? And I do mean SLOW.  For those new to the Ryan story to date:  ex-CIA action hero turned cabinet  member turned VP is now president after the prior president is killed in a  suicide bombing run at the end of  Debt of Honor.  Not just the president,  but also just about every other high ranking politico in DC. (Is Clancy  hinting something here?).  Ryan becomes president and must show the  doubters (and those evil media types) that he is a big man and can do the  job.  Of course, Clancy tries not to stray from his reputation as a  techo-guru and so he includes discussions on the investigation into the  terrorist attack as well as a superficially indepth look at militia life (a  group of militia folk decide to go after the President).Since his early  stories, Ryan has become increasingly unlikeable as a character.  He will  occassionally spout off on rhetoric and make long-winded proclamations on  everything from the Russians, so-called &quot;liberals,&quot; femanists, to  the role of women and the media.  This books seems to read like Clancy's  own manifesto, a book where the author injects his own beliefs into the  main character without bothering to be objective.  People who disagree with  these views or Ryan are depicted as the bad guys.  Ryan, it seems, never  makes a mistake: he just has tough choices to make the results of which can  cause the loss of lives.Clancy creates too many subplots and does  surprisingly short shrift with each of them.  This is strange after he has  spent hundreds of pages developing each subplot.  A story about a rival  politician is taken care of in quick order near the end of the book in a  nice, neat package.  Other subplots (a militia group and terrorist group  try to take advantage of the new president) also reach anticlimatic, and  unbelievable, conclusions. (i don't want to give a spoiler, but Ryan  actually orders a military operation to occur at the same time he is live  with a U.S. nation: kinda like a &quot;look, don't mess with us, we are  serious, see what we are doing right this very  second?&quot;Unfortunately, the long journey to the end of the book is  not worth it.  What Clancy needs is an editor, someone who will tell the  guy to cut down his writing.  To get on with it.  And to remember that what  made his earlier books popular was his plot and storylines.

As for  continuity, Clancy loves to pack his novels with subplots, which can be a  good thing, but here he apparently bit off more than he could chew, as one  subplot is rather arbitrarily cut off.

The only plot that starts and then goes nowhere is the one regarding the former vice-president who tries to discredit Jack Ryan's appointment as president. It's as if Clancy just lost interest in this matter or just didn't know what to do with it and just decided to let it die out, hoping readers wouldn't notice.In these times of possible war, reading such a novel makes you wonder if terrorists won't take some of the ideas presented by the author and actually decide to apply them.

For a while, my life events got in the way of continuing my reading of the series, and I only just now read Executive Orders, well after the real events of 9/11. How eerily prescient in many ways is Mr. Clancy's world of the real one.Jack Ryan is catapulted into the Presidency of the United States by the events at the close of Debt of Honor in which a Japanese airline pilot crashes his plane into the Capitol during an expanded joint session of Congress, wiping out most of the higher Congressional and Executive parts of government along with the Supreme Court. President Ryan is truly a citizen-statesman, not a politician, and has to gain the support of regular Americans while rebuilding the government. Add to his difficulties an attempted takeover by the ousted former vice-president, a kidnapping attempt on his younger daughter, an assassination attempt on himself, a large-scale bioterrorism attack on the US, a domestic terrorist bombing attempt, saber-rattling by China and India, and an actual war with the United Islamic Republic (the union of Iran and Iraq after the successful assassination of the Iraqi leader), and you have the usual multi-faceted Clancy plotting which keeps you glued to the book. And given the usual Clancy book length (approaching 900 pages of small font print in the hardcover edition), reading it takes a while and can lead to spousal irritation. Especially compelling are insights into the Presidency with Ryan's attempts to cope with the office and the climactic battle scenes played out over the final 100 pages or so. As usual, the good guys win, although the cost is high.I'm a registered Democrat, but I'd vote for Jack Ryan with his honest, straightforward, decisive governing style. Whither next, Mr. Ryan?

Now, in Executive Orders Clancy tackles the headaches of the power found within the Washington beltway. At the end of the last book, Clancy's hero, Jack Ryan, found himself a sort of unwilling vice president who became the most unlikely of presidents. Now, with the president, Congress and the Supreme Court all decimated, Ryan must face rebuilding the government while fending off challenges from international and domestic conspirators.As always, Clancy tends to get caught up in the details and inner-workings of virtually everything -- from the ebola virus to a crack military unit. The result is a novel that is close to 1,400 pages long, and the reader feels the weight of every turning page for the first half of the book. However, once the plot finally begins to thicken -- around page 650 or so -- it becomes very hard to put this book down. President Ryan becomes more of a collateral character in the book as others like John Clark circle around their leader to solve various crises. As the action builds to a crescendo the book begins to steamroll, with new twists and revelations on each page.Executive Orders is a very good book, but it is far from the best that Clancy has turned out. The previous two books -- Sum of All Fears and Debt of Honor -- set up the plot of Executive Orders and are much more tightly written. But if you are a Clancy fan, this is still a must and it won't disappoint.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Takes a while to get moving, but then...", "unixReviewTime": 1007078400, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2001"}

Executive Orders finds Ryan as a reluctant president, after a terrorist act destroyed much of the government. There are many plot threads which Clancy cuts back and forth between throughout the book. Unfortunately, some (like the China sub-plot) are boring, and others (such as the story involving a right-wing militia group) end up being irrelevant to the rest of the book.Many of the early pages are spent on Ryan's words and thoughts about how the government should be run, aka putting forth Clancy's political ideas. The pace does pick up considerably at around page 900, but 899 is a lot of pages to slog through to get to that point! Those like myself who do not have an encyclopedic knowledge of military terms and weaponry will likely find the big climax of the book confusing.With a lot of editing, this book could have been suspenseful.
